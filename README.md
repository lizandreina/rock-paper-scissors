# rock-paper-scissors
My first Javascript project!

This is my first project where I applied everything I've learned about JavaScript so far. It's a rock-paper-scissors game played against the computer that runs entirely in the console - later added some UI!

After learning a lot of theory up until this point, I finally put my knowledge into practice by working with:
- Variables.
- Operators.
- Data Types.
- String Methods.
- Logical and Comparison operators.
- Conditionals.
- Functions.
- Developer Tools.

Most importantly, this project allowed me to practice problem-solving and begin thinking like a programmer!

As mentioned previously, I later added some UI which allowed me to practice how to:
- Work with branches in Git.
- Manipulate the DOM.
- Use event listeners.
